# Python - Списки (list) Exercises:
# 1. Список и кортеж
# Создайте программу, которая будет принимать значения от пользователя и объединять их в список, а также в кортеж через запятую.

    l.append(s)

t = tuple(l)
s1 = tuple(s1)
print(l)
print(t)
print(s1)

# 2. Клонирование списка
# Создайте программу, которая будет копировать или клонировать список.

a = [12, 45, 67, 'test']
b = a
c = a.copy()
a[1] = 4
b[3] = 'Sergey'
c[0] = 'Good'
print(a)
print(b)
print(c)

# 3. Вложенный список
# Создайте список и выведите каждый его элемент на экран при помощи нескольких циклов for.
# Список данных:

lis = [[2, 5, 6], [5, 7, 1], [3, 6, 7, 34, 7, 0]]

i = 0
for x in lis:
    for j in lis[i]:
        print(j)
    i += 1

# 4. Работа со спискам
# Создайте функцию, которая будет принимать список данных и возвращать новый список состоящий из первого и последнего элемента переданного в функцию.
# Список данных:
# a = [5, 10, 15, 20, 25]
# # Должны получить список [5, 25]

print(first_end(a))

# 5. Простейшие списки
# Создайте список при помощи цикла for, который будет состоять из 5 элементов.
# Создайте пустой список и выполните над ним операции:
# - добавьте в него число 5 и -6
# - добавьте в него целиком весь первый список
# - выполните сортировку списка
# Выведите на экран оба списка без использования циклов.

l = list()
for i in range(5):
    l.append(i)

lst = list()
lst = [5, -6]
lst += l
lst.sort()
print(l)
print(lst)

# 6. Создание списка пользователем
# В программе получите строку введенную пользователем с клавиатуры.
# При помощи цикла разбейте строку на символы (отдельные буквы) и каждую отдельную букву добавьте как новый элемент списка.

s = input('Enter string: ')
lst = []

for i in s:
    lst += i

print(lst)

# 7. Вывод по отдельности
# У вас есть список:
# lis = ["Андрей", "Иван", "Василий", "Петро", "Максим", "Дима"]
# Вам необходимо вывести каждое слово из списка, после чего вывести каждую букву из каждого слова, например:
# Андрей // Сначала слово целиком
# А // Потом
# н // каждая
# д // буква
# р // из этого
# е // слова
# й // отдельно

lis = ["Андрей", "Иван", "Василий", "Петро", "Максим", "Дима"]

for a in lis:
    print(a)
    for b in a:
        print(b)

# 8. Наименьший элемент
# Есть список чисел:
# lis = [1, 34, 8, 0, -5, 7, 32, 74, 59, 92, 41, 10, -2]
# Найдите самый маленький элемент списка и переместите его в зависимости от условия:
# - если найденный элемент меньше за ноль, то поместите его в конец списка
# - если найденный элемент больше или равен нулю, то поместите его в начало списка.

lis = [1, 34, 8, 0, -5, 7, 32, 74, 59, 92, 41, 10, -2]

mm = min(lis)
lis.append(lis.pop(lis.index(mm))) if mm < 0 else [lis[lis.index(mm)]]+lis[0:lis.index(mm)]+lis[lis.index(mm)+1:]

print(lis)

# 9. Добавление списка пользователем
# Попросите пользователя ввести число в переменную N.
# Добавьте в список some N количество новых элементов. Каждый элемент также должен вводить пользователь с клавиатуры.
# Список:
# some = [9, "Hi", 23.5, "A"]

def num(s):
    try:
        return int(s)
    except ValueError:
        return float(s)

while True:
    n = input('Enter value: ')
    if n == '#0#': break
    if not n.isalpha(): n = num(n)
    some.append(n)
print(some)

# 10. Использование срезов
# Выведите каждый 3 элемент списка начиная с первого и заканчивая предпоследним.
# Список:

list = [3.4, 56, "Some", "Hi", 7, 3.8, 44]

print(list[0::3])

# 11. Использование индексов
# Выведите в списке третий элемент с конца.
# Список:

list = [3.4, 56, "Some", "Hi", 7, 3.8, 44]

print(list[-3])
